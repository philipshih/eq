        <p class="block-text">Hi! I'm Philip Shih, a 4th year undergraduate student at UC Berkeley. I love tackling unsolved problems and learning skills that allow me to make a positive impact in the lives of others.</p>
        <p class="block-text">I am particularly interested in radiation oncology and deep learning in medical imaging and radiation therapy. Previously, I conducted research on TIM-Barrel dynamics through the Klinman Group, and led an independent project on machine learning in fMRI imaging through the Undergraduate Lab at Berkeley. I have also worked as an intern for UC Davis Health, where I took part in a premedical program that aims to produce physician-scientists who work towards eliminating health inequities in underserved populations.</p>
        <p class="block-text">Outside of school, I spend my time playing the piano and producing music. I enjoy listening to R&B, EDM, and classical music, and I'm always looking to discover new artists and genres. I'm also an avid basketball player and fan of the Sacramento Kings.</p>
