     <h1>About Me</h1>
   <div class="contents-right">  
     <p>I'm Philip, a first-year medical student.</p>
     <p>I'm interested in radiation oncology and deep learning in medical imaging and radiation therapy. I previously conducted research on TIM-Barrel dynamics through the Klinman Group, and led an independent project on machine learning in fMRI imaging through the Undergraduate Lab at Berkeley. I've also worked as an intern for UC Davis Health, where I took part in a pre-medical program that aims to produce physician-scientists who work towards eliminating health inequities in underserved populations.</p>
